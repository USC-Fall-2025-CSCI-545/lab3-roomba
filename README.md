# LAB3
Note:

The demo script `adarrt.py` is written for Python 2 and is provided for reference only.

In Lab 3, both Python 2 and Python 3 versions of the script are already included in the Docker images provided (as referenced in the Overleaf file), depending on which version you choose to use.

The Lab 3 simulation supports both Python 2 and Python 3 implementations; however, the real-world lab only supports Python 2.
